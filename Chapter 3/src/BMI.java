/*
 * 5. In programming Exercise 5 of the previous chapter you were asked to calculate
the BMI of an individual. Adapt this program so that it also reports on whether
the BMI is in a healthy range, or if it indicates the person is underweight or
overweight, using the following table:

<18.5 Underweight
18.5â€”24.9 Healthy
>24.9 Overweight
 */

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter your weight in kg: ");
		weight = sc.nextDouble();
		System.out.println("Enter your height in meters: ");
		height = sc.nextDouble();

		System.out.println("Your BMI is: " + bmi);
